    "Our goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of unsupervised machine learning in categorizing stocks based on risk-return profiles to optimize investment portfolios. We use historical stock market data, including daily prices, volatility, and financial ratios, to represent stock characteristics. Through clustering techniques and dimensionality reduction, we hope to identify distinct categories that reflect different risk-return dynamics. Additionally, performance will be measured by evaluating portfolio stability compared to traditional methods, which will show us how useful unsupervised learning is for predicting stocks in real-world situations. We offer specific insights into applying unsupervised learning for stock prediction, focusing on Apple Inc's  data from 1980 to 2021."

    "\n",
    "A stock market is a market where people are able to purchase shares from public companies. These shares can help an individual gain profits, the company to raise capital, and provide people a way to invest in companies they believe have potential<a name=\"simplilearn\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#simplilearn). It is for these reasons that finding a way to predict how stock market prices may change is crucial. \n",
    "\n",
    "The stock market is known to be extremely unpredictable and full of unknown variables, which can influence stock prices one way or another.  For many years, researchers have been working to try to predict stock prices. However, this has been quite difficult with the presence of unexpected variables like the pandemic<a name=\"projectpro\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#projectpro). Therefore, analysts have instead tried to focus on short term predictions that estimate how the stock market could’ve changed. Since the stock market is so complex considering the many variables influencing its change, AI steps in to help us process these variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are already several different types of models used to predict the stock market, and two different ways to analyze the stocks. Fundamental analysis looks at a company stock’s intrinsic value and analyzes historical as well as current data. They are used mainly with long-term investments. Technical analysis looks at measurable data of the stock activities as well as analyzing present and historical data for short-term investments<a name=\"neptuneai\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#neptuneai). In addition, technical analysis is influenced by current news while fundamental analysis is not really affected by them. In the case of Neptune a.i, they have chosen to use technical analysis with a Long Short Term Memory framework to build a model to predict the stock market. \n",
    "\n",
    "South Dakota State University has also developed their own A.I model, dubbed “ALERTA-NET” where they have incorporated macroeconomic data in their model which have resulted in more accurate predictions<a name=\"sdsu\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#sdsu). It is examples like these that stand to prove that researchers are still looking to build models that can predict the stock market with higher accuracy. The uncertainty of the stock market makes this task so difficult, and the importance of the stock market in terms of the economy as well as profits makes the pursuit of accurate stock market prediction models so crucial.

Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms), measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once).\n",

    "**Our Response**:\n",
    "Our objective is to build a machine learning model that predicts Apple's future stock prices for the years 1980 to 2021, using past data from Yahoo Finance. We will use Time Series Analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to identify patterns, trends, and potential factors that influence Apple's historical stock performance. To measure our model's accuracy, we will use Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which quantify the accuracy of our predictions of actual stock prices. Additionally, our problem is highly replicable in financial markets, where investors and analysts often look for such forecasts to make their decisions. For an ML-relevant solution, we will use time series forecasting models like ARIMA, SARIMA, or LSTM networks. These models will analyze historical stock prices and relevant financial indicators to predict future stock movements."

    "- **Anonymity and Privacy:** While stock market data is generally anonymized and does not contain personal information, we will rigorously review the datasets to ensure that there is no indirect way to identify individuals or private entities. Any data that could potentially lead to identification will be further anonymized or excluded from our analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Bias and Fairness:** We recognize that financial markets can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including economic, political, and social elements. We will critically assess our model for any biases that may arise from the data or the algorithms used. Efforts will be made to ensure that our predictions do not inadvertently favor or disadvantage any particular group or individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Responsible Use of Predictions:** We are aware of the potential impact that stock price predictions can have on individuals, companies, and the economy. Our project is intended for academic purposes and should not be used as financial advice. We will clearly communicate the limitations and uncertainties of our predictions to prevent misuse or overreliance on our model.\n",

    "- **Compliance with Regulations:** We will adhere to all relevant laws and regulations related to financial data and securities trading. This includes respecting insider trading laws and ensuring that our project does not contribute to market manipulation or other unethical practices.\n",
