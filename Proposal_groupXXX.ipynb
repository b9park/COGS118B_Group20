    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project must include some elements of unsupervised learning, but you are welcome to include some supervised or other learning approaches as well.\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "**Solution Overview:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution aims to predict stock price movements using primarily unsupervised machine learning techniques. The focus will be on exploring the underlying patterns and structures in the stock market data without relying on labeled outcomes. The insights gained from unsupervised learning will then be used to inform a simple supervised model for price prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised Learning for Feature Extraction and Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clustering for Market Segmentation**: We will use clustering algorithms, such as K-means and DBSCAN, to segment stocks based on historical price movements, trading volume, and other financial indicators. This will help us identify groups of stocks with similar behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) will be applied to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving its structure. This will assist in visualizing the stock market data and identifying key features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Association Rule Mining**: We will explore association rule mining to uncover relationships between different stocks or financial indicators. This can reveal interesting patterns, such as stocks that tend to move together.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Anomaly Detection**: Techniques like Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM will be used to detect anomalies in the stock market data, which could indicate potential market disruptions or opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised Learning for Price Prediction**\n",
    "\n",
    "After extracting insights and features using unsupervised techniques, we will employ a simple supervised learning model to predict stock price movements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logistic Regression**: Based on the features and patterns identified through unsupervised learning, we will use logistic regression to predict whether a stock's price will go up or down in the next trading period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will evaluate the performance of our unsupervised models using metrics such as silhouette score (for clustering quality) and reconstruction error (for dimensionality reduction). The supervised logistic regression model will be evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Details**\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to implement our solution using Python, with libraries such as `scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms, `pandas` for data manipulation, and `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization. The implementation will include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loading the dataset, handling missing values, and normalizing the features.\n",
    "2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Applying clustering, dimensionality reduction, association rule mining, and anomaly detection techniques.\n",
    "3. **Feature Selection**: Selecting relevant features based on insights from unsupervised learning.\n",

    "- **Data Source Transparency:** We will only use publicly available financial data from reputable sources, such as stock exchanges, financial news websites, and government reports. We will clearly document the sources of our data to ensure transparency and accountability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Anonymity and Privacy:** While stock market data is generally anonymized and does not contain personal information, we will rigorously review the datasets to ensure that there is no indirect way to identify individuals or private entities. Any data that could potentially lead to identification will be further anonymized or excluded from our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Informed Consent:** For any data that may involve individual contributors or proprietary information, we will ensure that informed consent has been obtained. This includes clear communication about the purpose of the data collection and the intended use of the data in our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bias and Fairness:** We recognize that financial markets can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including economic, political, and social elements. We will critically assess our model for any biases that may arise from the data or the algorithms used. Efforts will be made to ensure that our predictions do not inadvertently favor or disadvantage any particular group or individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Responsible Use of Predictions:** We are aware of the potential impact that stock price predictions can have on individuals, companies, and the economy. Our project is intended for academic purposes and should not be used as financial advice. We will clearly communicate the limitations and uncertainties of our predictions to prevent misuse or overreliance on our model.\n",
